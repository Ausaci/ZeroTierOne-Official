             * This works by setting bit N in the 'have' bit mask and then setting X bits
             * in 'expecting' if the 'expecting' field is non-zero. Since the packet head
             * does not carry the expecting fragment count (it will be provided as zero) and
             * all subsequent fragments should have the same fragment count, this will yield
             * a 'have' of 1 and an 'expecting' of 0 after the head arrives. Then 'expecting'
             * will be set to the right bit pattern by the first fragment and 'true' will get
             * returned once all fragments have arrived and therefore all flags in 'have' are
             * set.
             *
             * Receipt of a four-fragment packet would look like:
             *
             * after head      : have == 0x01, expecting == 0x00 -> false
             * after fragment 1: have == 0x03, expecting == 0x0f -> false
             * after fragment 2: have == 0x07, expecting == 0x0f -> false
             * after fragment 3: have == 0x0f, expecting == 0x0f -> true (done!)
             *
             * This algorithm is just a few instructions in ASM and also correctly handles
             * duplicated packet fragments. If all fragments never arrive receipt eventually
             * times out and this is discarded.
