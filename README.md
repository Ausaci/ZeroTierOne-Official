tetanus: work-in-progress repo for ZeroTier in (mostly) pure Rust
======

This repository will go away or be mothballed in the future. It's a work in progress and is a bit of a monorepo that will probably get broken up eventually.

The ZeroTier Rust code is currently sort of unlicensed pending actual release. We haven't decided what license to use yet, but we plan on it being something FOSS-friendlier than the current BSL in the old repo.
