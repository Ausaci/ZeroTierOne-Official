 * Packet format:
 *   <[8] 64-bit packet ID / crypto IV>
 *   <[5] destination ZT address>
 *   <[5] source ZT address>
 *   <[1] outer visible flags, cipher, and hop count (bits: FFCCHHH)>
 *   <[8] 64-bit MAC (or trusted path ID in trusted path mode)>
 *   [... -- begin encryption envelope -- ...]
 *   <[1] inner envelope flags (MS 3 bits) and verb (LS 5 bits)>
 *   [... verb-specific payload ...]
 *
 * Packets smaller than 28 bytes are invalid and silently discarded.
 *
 * The hop count field is masked during message authentication computation
 * and is thus the only field that is mutable in transit. It's incremented
 * when roots or other nodes forward packets and exists to prevent infinite
 * forwarding loops and to detect direct paths.
 *
 * HELLO is normally sent in the clear with the POLY1305_NONE cipher suite
 * and with Poly1305 computed on plain text (Salsa20/12 is still used to
 * generate a one time use Poly1305 key). As of protocol version 11 HELLO
 * also includes a terminating HMAC (last 48 bytes) that significantly
 * hardens HELLO authentication beyond what a 64-bit MAC can guarantee.
 *
 * Fragmented packets begin with a packet header whose fragment bit (bit
 * 0x40 in the flags field) is set. This constitutes fragment zero. The
 * total number of expected fragments is contained in each subsequent
 * fragment packet. Unfragmented packets must not have the fragment bit
 * set or the receiver will expect at least one additional fragment.
 *
 * --
 *
 * Packet fragment format (fragments beyond 0):
 *   <[8] packet ID of packet to which this fragment belongs>
 *   <[5] destination ZT address>
 *   <[1] 0xff here signals that this is a fragment>
 *   <[1] total fragments (most significant 4 bits), fragment no (LS 4 bits)>
 *   <[1] ZT hop count (least significant 3 bits; others are reserved)>
 *   <[...] fragment data>
 *
 * The protocol supports a maximum of 16 fragments including fragment 0
 * which contains the full packet header (with fragment bit set). Fragments
 * thus always carry fragment numbers between 1 and 15. All fragments
 * belonging to the same packet must carry the same total fragment count in
 * the most significant 4 bits of the fragment numbering field.
 *
 * All fragments have the same packet ID and destination. The packet ID
 * doubles as the grouping identifier for fragment reassembly.
 *
 * Fragments do not carry their own packet MAC. The entire packet is
 * authenticated once it is assembled by the receiver. Incomplete packets
 * are discarded after a receiver configured period of time.

     *
     * HELLO is sent to initiate a new pairing between two nodes and
     * periodically to refresh information.
     *
     * HELLO is the only packet ever sent without whole payload encryption,
     * though an inner encrypted envelope exists to obscure all fields that
     * do not need to be sent in the clear. There is nothing in this
     * encrypted section that would be catastrophic if it leaked, but it's
     * good to proactively limit exposed information.
     *
     * Inner encryption is AES-CTR with a key derived using KBKDF and a
     * label indicating this specific usage. A 96-bit CTR IV precedes this
     * encrypted section.
     *
     * Authentication and encryption in HELLO and OK(HELLO) are always done
     * with the long-lived identity key, not ephemeral shared keys. This
     * is so ephemeral key negotiation can always occur on the first try
     * even if things get out of sync e.g. by one side restarting. Nothing
     * in HELLO is likely to be dangerous if decrypted later.
     *
     * HELLO and OK(HELLO) include an extra HMAC at the end of the packet.
     * This authenticates them to a level of certainty beyond that afforded
     * by regular AEAD. HMAC is computed over the whole packet prior to
     * packet MAC and with the 3-bit hop count field masked as it is
     * with regular packet AEAD, and it is then included in the regular
     * packet MAC.
     *
     * LEGACY: for legacy reasons the MAC field of HELLO is a poly1305
     * MAC initialized in the same manner as 1.x. Since HMAC provides
     * additional full 384-bit strength authentication this should not be
     * a problem for FIPS.
     *
     * Several legacy fields are present as well for the benefit of 1.x nodes.
     * These will go away and become simple reserved space once 1.x is no longer
     * supported. Some are self-explanatory. The "encrypted zero" is rather
     * strange. It's a 16-bit zero value encrypted using Salsa20/12 and the
     * long-lived identity key shared by the two peers. It tells 1.x that an
     * old encrypted field is no longer there and that it should stop parsing
     * the packet at that point.
     *
     * 1.x does not understand the dictionary and HMAC fields, but it will
     * ignore them due to the "encrypted zero" field indicating that the
     * packet contains no more information.
     *
     * Dictionary fields (defines start with ZT_PROTO_HELLO_NODE_META_):
     *
     *   INSTANCE_ID - a 64-bit unique value generated on each node start
     *   LOCATOR - signed record enumerating this node's trusted contact points
     *   EPHEMERAL_PUBLIC - Ephemeral public key(s)
     *
     * OK will contain EPHEMERAL_PUBLIC of the responding node and:
     *
     *   EPHEMERAL_ACK - SHA384(EPHEMERAL_PUBLIC from HELLO)
     *
     * The following optional fields may also be present:
     *
     *   PREFERRED_CIPHER - preferred symmetric encryption mode
     *   HOSTNAME - arbitrary short host name for this node
     *   ARCH - system architecture (CPU type, bits, etc.)
     *   OSNAME - system operating system name
     *   OSVERSION - operating system version
     *   CONTACT - arbitrary short contact information string for this node
     *   SOFTWARE_VENDOR - short name or description of vendor, such as a URL
     *   COMPLIANCE - bit mask containing bits for e.g. a FIPS-compliant node
     *
     * The timestamp field in OK is echoed but the others represent the sender
     * of the OK and are not echoes from HELLO. The dictionary in OK typically
     * only contains the EPHEMERAL fields, allowing the receiver of the OK to
     * confirm that both sides know the correct keys and thus begin using the
     * ephemeral shared secret to send packets.
     *
