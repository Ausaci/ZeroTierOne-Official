 * Certificate store and chain validator.

 * WARNING: SharedPtr<Entry> entries returned from a trust store are valid
 * only as long as the trust store exists. The trust store is a core object
 * that lives as long as a Node, so this isn't an issue in the core, but it
 * should be remembered when testing.
 *
 * This is because each Entry includes a reference to its parent's mutex and
 * is synchronized by this mutex so its fields are safe to access while the
 * parent trust store is being modified or synchronized.
 *
 * This also means entries can't be moved between TrustStore instances,
 * hence there are no methods for doing that. There's only one instance in a
 * node anyway.
