/**
 * Certificate of network membership
 *
 * This is the fundamental permission object issued by network controllers to members of networks
 * to admit them into networks.
 *
 * A certificate of membership (COM) consists of a series of tuples called qualifiers as well
 * as the full identity fingerprint of the node being admitted, the address of the controller
 * (for sanity checking), and a signature.
 *
 * A qualifier is a tuple of three 64-bit unsigned integers: an id, a value, and a delta.
 *
 * Certiciates are checked between peers by determining if they agree. If the absolute value
 * of the difference between any two qualifier values exceeds its delta, the certificates do
 * not agree. A delta if 1 for example means that the values of two peers may differ by no more
 * than one. A delta of 0 indicates values that must be the same. A delta of uint64_max is for
 * informational tuples that are not included in certificate checking, as this means they may
 * differ by any amount.
 *
 * All COMs contain three initial tuples: timestamp, network ID, and the address of the
 * issued-to node. The latter is informational. The network ID must equal exactly, though in
 * theory a controller could allow a delta there to e.g. allow cross-communication between all
 * of its networks. (This has never been done in practice.) The most important field is the
 * timestamp, whose delta defines a moving window within which certificates must be timestamped
 * by the network controller to agree. A certificate that is too old will fall out of this
 * window vs its peers and will no longer be considered valid.
 *
 * (Revocations are a method to rapidly revoke access that works alongside this slower but
 * more definitive method.)
 *
 * Certificate of membership wire format:
 *
 * This wire format comes in two versions: version 1 for ZeroTier 1.x, which will
 * eventually go away once 1.x is out of support, and version 2 for ZeroTier 2.x and later.
 *
 * Version 2:
 *
 * <[1] wire format type byte: 1 or 2>
 * <[2] 16-bit number of qualifier tuples>
 * <[...] qualifier tuples>
 * <[48] fingerprint hash of identity of peer to whom COM was issued>
 * <[5] address of network controller>
 * <[2] 16-bit size of signature>
 * <[...] signature>
 *
 * Version 1 is identical except the fingerprint hash is omitted and is instead loaded
 * into a series of six informational tuples. The signature size is also omitted and a
 * 96-byte signature field is assumed.
 *
 * Qualifier tuples must appear in numeric order of ID, and the first three tuples
 * must have IDs 0, 1, and 2 being the timestamp, network ID, and issued-to address
 * respectively. In version 1 COMs the IDs 3-8 are used to pack in the full identity
 * fingerprint, so these are reserved as well. Optional additional tuples (not currently
 * used) must use ID 65536 or higher.
 *
 * Signatures are computed over tuples only for backward compatibility with v1, and we
 * don't plan to change this. Tuples are emitted into a buffer in ascending numeric
 * order with the fingerprint hash being packed into tuple IDs 3-8 and this buffer is
 * then signed.
