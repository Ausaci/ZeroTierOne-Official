/// memory copying by passing buffers around instead of memcpy'ing when
/// packet data is passed into and out of the core.
///
/// IMPORTANT NOTE: when these are fed into the ZeroTier core, drop() is
/// elided via std::mem::forget(). Node does this automatically so usually
/// users of this API do not need to be aware of it, but it's worth mentioning
/// in case someone re-implements calls directly into the core. Dropping this
/// after handing it back to the core could result in mytserious corruption
/// bugs or double-free.
///
/// This does not implement copy or clone because that would result in this
/// memory being dropped more than once. Use Rc or Arc to share.
