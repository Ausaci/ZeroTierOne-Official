zssp has been moved into it's own crate.

zssp has been cut up into several files, only the new zssp.rs file contains the critical security path.

Standardized the naming conventions for security variables throughout zssp.

Implemented a safer version of write_all for zssp to use. This has 3 benefits: it completely prevents unknown io errors, making error handling easier and self-documenting; it completely prevents src from being truncated in dest, putting in an extra barrier to prevent catastrophic key truncation; and it has slightly less performance overhead than a write_all.

Implemented a safer version of read_exact for zssp to use. This has similar benefits to the previous change.

Refactored most buffer logic to use safe_read_exact and safe_write_all, the resulting code is less verbose and easier to analyze and verify. Because of this refactor the buffer overrun below was caught.

Fixed a buffer overrun panic when decoding alice_ratchet_key_fingerprint
